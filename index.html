            <h2>🎤 The Rap God</h2>
            <p>
                Marshall Bruce Mathers III, known professionally as Eminem, is an American rapper, songwriter,
                and record producer. Born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri, Eminem is widely
                regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time and has been credited with popularizing
                hip hop in Middle America.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rising from poverty and a tumultuous childhood in Detroit, Michigan, Eminem's raw talent,
                lyrical prowess, and controversial themes catapulted him to international fame. His alter ego,
                Slim Shady, became a cultural phenomenon, pushing boundaries and challenging norms in the
                music industry.

            <h2>📖 Early Life & Struggles</h2>
            <p>
                Eminem had a turbulent childhood, marked by poverty and allegations of abuse. He was raised
                by his mother, Debbie Mathers, and moved frequently between Missouri and Michigan. He dropped
                out of Lincoln High School at age 17 after repeating the ninth grade three times due to
                truancy and poor grades.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the hardships, Eminem found solace in hip-hop. He began rapping with his friend Mike
                Ruby at age 14, adopting the stage name "M&M" (based on his initials), which later evolved
                into "Eminem." He participated in freestyle rap battles in Detroit and gained recognition in
                the underground hip-hop scene.

            <p>
                Eminem is credited with breaking racial barriers for white rappers in a predominantly
                African American industry. His technical skill, complex rhyme schemes, and storytelling
                ability have influenced countless artists across genres.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond music, Eminem founded Shady Records in 1999, which has signed successful artists
